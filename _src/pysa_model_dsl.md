import {FbInternalOnly} from 'docusaurus-plugin-internaldocs-fb/internal';

We have started developing a model Domain Specific Language (DSL) that can be
used to solve many of the same problems as
[model generators](pysa_precollectors.md), while still keeping model information
in `.pysa` files. The DSL aims to provide a compact way to generate models for
all code that matches a given query. This allows users to avoid writing hundreds
or thousands of models.

## Basics

The most basic form of querying Pysa's DSL is by generating models based on
function names. To do so, add a `ModelQuery` to your `.pysa` file:

```python
ModelQuery(
  # Indicates the name of the query
  name = "get_foo_sources",
  # Indicates that this query is looking for functions
  find = "functions",
  # Indicates those functions should be called 'foo'
  where = [name.matches("foo")],
  # Indicates that matched function should be modeled as returning 'Test' taint
  model = [
    Returns(TaintSource[Test]),
  ],
  # Indicates that the generated models should include the 'foo' and 'foo2' functions
  expected_models = [
    "def file.foo() -> TaintSource[Test]: ...",
    "def file.foo2() -> TaintSource[Test]: ..."
  ],
  # Indicates that the generated models should not include the 'bar' function
  unexpected_models = [
    "def file.bar() -> TaintSource[Test]: ..."
  ]
)
```

Things to note in this example:

1. The `name` clause is the name of your query.
1. The `find` clause lets you pick whether you want to model functions, methods
   or attributes.
1. The `where` clause is how you refine your criteria for when a model should be
   generated - in this example, we're filtering for functions whose names
   contain `foo`.
1. The `model` clause is a list of models to generate. Here, the syntax means
   that the functions matching the where clause should be modelled as returning
   `TaintSource[Test]`.
1. The `expected_models` and `unexpected_models` clauses are optional and allow
   you to specify models that should or should not be generated by your query.

When invoking Pysa, if you add the
`--dump-model-query-results /path/to/output/file` flag to your invocation, the
generated models, sorted under the respective ModelQuery that created them, will
be written to a file in JSON format.

```
$ pyre analyze --dump-model-query-results /path/to/output/file.txt
...
> Emitting the model query results to `/my/home/dir/.pyre/model_query_results.pysa`
```

You can then view this file to see the generated models.

You can also test DSL queries using
[`pyre query`](querying_pyre.md#model-query).

Example

```bash
pyre query "model_query('/data/sandcastle/boxes/instagram-server/distillery/stubs/taint/core_privacy_security/','model_query_name')" > /tmp/model_query_output
cat /tmp/model_query_output | jq .
```

</FbInternalOnly>

## Name clauses

The `name` clause describes what the query is meant to find. Normally it follows
the format of `get_` + [what the query matches with in the `where` clause] +
[`_sinks`, `_source` and/or `_tito`]. This clause should be unique for every
ModelQuery within a file.

## Find clauses

The `find` clause specifies what entities to model, and currently supports
`"functions"`, `"methods"`, `"attributes"`, and `"globals"`. `"functions"`
indicates that you're querying for free functions, `"methods"` indicates that
you're only querying class methods, `"attributes"` indicates that you're
querying for attributes on classes, and `"globals"` indicates that you're
querying for names available in the global scope.

Note that `"attributes"` also includes constructor-initialized attributes, such
as `C.y` in the following case:

```python
class C:
  x = ...

  def __init__(self):
    self.y = ...
```

Note that `"globals"` currently don't infer the type annotation of their value,
so querying is more effective when they're properly annotated.

```python
def fun(x: int, y: str) -> int:
    return x + int(y)

a = fun(1, "2") # -> typing.Any
b: int = fun(1, "2") # -> int
```

## Where clauses

`where` clauses are a list of predicates, all of which must match for an entity
to be modelled. Note that certain predicates are only compatible with specific
find clause kinds.

### `fully_qualified_name.matches`

The most basic query predicate is a name match - the name you're searching for
is compiled as a regex, and the entity's fully qualified name is compared
against it. A fully qualified name includes the module and class - for example,
for a method `foo` in class `C` which is part of module `bar`, the fully
qualified name is `bar.C.foo`.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_starting_with_foo",
  find = ...,
  where = [
    fully_qualified_name.matches("foo.*")
  ],
  model = ...
)
```

:::caution

`matches` performs a partial match! For instance, `matches("bar")` will match
against a function named `my_module.foobarbaz`. To perform a full match, use `^`
and `$`. For instance: `matches("^.*\.bar$")`.

:::

### `fully_qualified_name.equals`

This clause will match when the entity's fully qualified name is exactly the
same as the specified string.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_bar_C_foo",
  find = ...,
  where = [
    fully_qualified_name.equals("bar.C.foo")
  ],
  model = ...
)
```

### `name.matches`

The `name.matches` clause is similar to `fully_qualified_name.matches`, but
matches against the actual name of the entity, excluding module and class names.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_starting_with_foo",
  find = ...,
  where = [
    name.matches("foo.*")
  ],
  model = ...
)
```

:::caution

`matches` performs a partial match! For instance, `matches("bar")` will match
against a function named `foobarbaz`. To perform a full match, use `^` and `$`.
For instance: `matches("^.*bar$")`.

:::

### `name.equals`

The `name.equals` clause is similar to `fully_qualified_name.equals`, but
matches against the actual name of the entity, excluding module and class names.

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_foo",
  find = ...,
  where = [
    name.equals("foo")
  ],
  model = ...
)
```

### `return_annotation` clauses

Model queries allow for querying based on the return annotation of a callable.
Note that this `where` clause does not work when the `find` clause specifies
`"attributes"`.

#### `return_annotation.equals`

The clause will match when the fully-qualified name of the callable's return
type matches the specified value exactly.

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_return_HttpRequest_sources",
  find = "functions",
  where = [
    return_annotation.equals("django.http.HttpRequest"),
  ],
  model = Returns(TaintSource[UserControlled, Via[http_request]])
)
```

#### `return_annotation.matches`

This is similar to the previous clause, but will match when the fully-qualified
name of the callable's return type matches the specified pattern.

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_return_Request_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = [
    return_annotation.matches(".*Request"),
  ],
  model = Returns(TaintSource[UserControlled, Via[http_request]])
)
```

#### `return_annotation.is_annotated_type`

This will match when a callable's return type is annotated with
[`typing.Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated).
This is a type used to decorate existing types with context-specific metadata,
e.g.

```python
from typing import Annotated

def bad() -> Annotated[str, "SQL"]:
  ...
```

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_return_annotated_sources",
  find = functions,
  where = [
    return_annotation.is_annotated_type(),
  ],
  model = Returns(TaintSource[SQL])
)
```

This query would match on functions like the one shown above.

#### `return_annotation.extends`

This will match when a callable's return type is a class that is a subclass of
the provided class names. Note that this will **only work on class names**. More
complex types like `Union`, `Callable` are not supported. The `extends` clause
also takes boolean parameters `is_transitive`, which when set to true means it
will match when the class is a transitive subclass, otherwise it will only match
when it is a direct subclass, and `includes_self`, which determines whether
`extends(T)` should include `T` itself.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_return_annotation_extends",
  find = functions,
  where = [
    return_annotation.extends("test.A", is_transitive=True, includes_self=True),
  ],
  model = Returns(TaintSource[Test])
)
```

Given the following Python code in module `test`:

```python
class A:
  pass

class B(A):
  pass

class C:
  pass

def foo() -> A: ...
def bar() -> B: ...
def baz() -> C: ...
```

The above query would match `bar` and `baz` which are transitive subclasses of
`A`, but not `foo`, since `includes_self` was `False`.

If the return type is `Optional[T]`, or `ReadOnly[T]`, they will be effectively
treated as if they were type `T` for the purpose of matching.

```python
from typing import Optional
from pyre_extensions import ReadOnly

# These should all also match
def bar_optional() -> Optional[B]: ...
def bar_readonly() -> ReadOnly[B]: ...
def baz2() -> Optional[ReadOnly[Optional[C]]]: ...
```

### `type_annotation` clauses

Model queries allow for querying based on the type annotation of a `global`.
Note that this is similar to the
[`return_annotation`](#return_annotation-clauses) clauses shown previously. See
also: `Parameters` model [`type_annotation`](#type_annotation-clause) clauses.

#### `type_annotation.equals`

The clause will match when the fully-qualified name of the global's explicitly
annotated type matches the specified value exactly.

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_string_dicts",
  find = "globals",
  where = [
    type_annotation.equals("typing.Dict[(str, str)]"),
  ],
  model = GlobalModel(TaintSource[SelectDict])
)
```

For example, the above query when run on the following code:

```python
unannotated_dict = {"hello": "world", "abc": "123"}
annotated_dict: Dict[str, str] = {"hello": "world", "abc": "123"}
```

will result in a model for `annotated_dict: TaintSource[SelectDict]`.

#### `type_annotation.matches`

This is similar to the previous clause, but will match when the fully-qualified
name of the global's explicit type annotation matches the specified pattern.

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_anys",
  find = "globals",
  where = [
    return_annotation.matches(".*typing.Any.*"),
  ],
  model = GlobalModel(TaintSource[SelectAny])
)
```

#### `type_annotation.is_annotated_type`

This will match when a global's type is annotated with
[`typing.Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated).
This is a type used to decorate existing types with context-specific metadata,
e.g.

```python
from typing import Annotated

result: Annotated[str, "SQL"] = ...
```

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_return_annotated_sources",
  find = globals,
  where = [
    return_annotation.is_annotated_type(),
  ],
  model = GlobalModel(TaintSource[SQL])
)
```

This query would match on functions like the one shown above.

#### `type_annotation.extends`

This behaves the same way as the `return_annotation.extends()` clause. Please
refer to [the section above](#return_annotationextends).

### `any_parameter` clauses

Model queries allow matching callables where any parameter matches a given
clause. For now, the only clauses we support for parameters is specifying
conditions on the type annotation of a callable's parameters. These can be used
in conjunction with the `Parameters` model clause (see
[`type_annotation`](#type_annotation-clause)) to taint specific parameters. Note
that this `where` clause does not work when the `find` clause specifies
`"attributes"`.

#### `any_parameter.annotation.equals`

This clause will match all callables which have at least one parameter where the
fully-qualified name of the parameter type matches the specified value exactly.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_parameter_HttpRequest_sources",
  find = "functions",
  where = [
    any_parameter.annotation.equals("django.http.HttpRequest")
  ],
  model =
    Parameters(
      TaintSource[UserControlled],
      where=[
        name.equals("request"),
        name.matches("data$")
      ]
    )
)
```

#### `any_parameter.annotation.matches`

This clause will match all callables which have at least one parameter where the
fully-qualified name of the parameter type matches the specified pattern.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_parameter_Request_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = [
    any_parameter.annotation.matches(".*Request")
  ],
  model =
    Parameters(
      TaintSource[UserControlled],
      where=[
        type_annotation.matches(".*Request"),
      ]
    )
)
```

#### `any_parameter.annotation.is_annotated_type`

This clause will match all callables which have at least one parameter with type
`typing.Annotated`.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_parameter_annotated_sources",
  find = "functions",
  where = [
    any_parameter.annotation.is_annotated_type()
  ],
  model =
    Parameters(
      TaintSource[Test],
      where=[
        type_annotation.is_annotated_type(),
      ]
    )
)
```

### `AnyOf` clauses

There are cases when we want to model entities which match any of a set of
clauses. The `AnyOf` clause represents exactly this case.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_AnyOf_example",
  find = "methods",
  where = [
    AnyOf(
      any_parameter.annotation.is_annotated_type(),
      return_annotation.is_annotated_type(),
    )
  ],
  model = ...
)
```

### `AllOf` clauses

There are cases when we want to model entities which match all of a set of
clauses. The `AllOf` clause may be used in this case.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_AllOf_example",
  find = "methods",
  where = [
    AnyOf(
      AllOf(
        cls.extends("a.b"),
        cls.name.matches("Foo"),
      ),
      AllOf(
        cls.extends("c.d"),
        cls.name.matches("Bar")
      )
    )
  ],
  model = ...
)
```

### `Decorator` clauses

`Decorator` clauses are used to find callables decorated with decorators that
match a pattern. This clause takes decorator clauses as arguments.

#### Decorator `fully_qualified_callee` clauses

The `fully_qualified_callee` decorator clause is used to match on the fully
qualified name of a decorator. That is, the fully qualified name of a higher
order function. The supported name clauses are the same as the ones discussed
above for model query constraints, i.e.,

- `fully_qualified_callee.matches("pattern")`, which will match when the
  decorator matches the regex pattern specified as a string, and
- `fully_qualified_callee.equals("foo.bar.d1")`, which will match when the
  fully-qualified name of the decorator equals the specified string exactly.

For example, if you wanted to find all functions that are decorated by
`@App().route()`, a decorator whose definition is in file `my_module.py`:

```python
class App:
  def route(self, func: Callable) -> Callable:
    ...
```

You can write:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_my_module_app_route_decorator",
  find = "functions",
  where = Decorator(fully_qualified_callee.equals("my_module.App.route")),
  ...
)
```

which is arguably better because it is more precise than regex matching, or

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_app_route_decorator",
  find = "functions",
  where = Decorator(fully_qualified_callee.matches(".*\.App\.route")),
  ...
)
```

**Clarification.** As another example, assume the following code is in file
`test.py`:

```python
class Flask:
    def route(self, func: Callable) -> Callable:
      ...
application = Flask()
@application.route
def my_view():
  pass
```

Then, for decorator `@application.route`, clause `fully_qualified_callee`
matches against the decorator's fully qualified name `test.Flask.route`, as
oppposed to the local identifier's fully qualified name `test.application.route`
(that refers to this decorator).

#### Decorator `name` clauses

The `name` clause is similar to `fully_qualified_name`, but matches against the
actual name of the entity, excluding module and class names.

#### Decorator `arguments` clauses

The `arguments` clauses is used to match on the arguments provided to the
decorator. The supported arguments clauses are `arguments.contains(...)`, which
will match when the arguments specified are a subset of the decorator's
arguments, and `arguments.equals(...)`, which will match when the decorator has
the specified arguments exactly.

`arguments.contains()` supports both positional and keyword arguments. For
positional arguments, the list of positonal arguments supplied to the
`arguments.contains()` clause must be a prefix of the list of positional
arguments on the actual decorator, i.e. the value of the argument at each
position should be the same. For example, with the following Python code:

```python
@d1(a, 2)
def match1():
  ...

@d1(a, 2, 3, 4)
def match2():
  ...

@d1(2, a):
def nomatch():
  ...
```

This query will match both `match1()` and `match2()`, but not `nomatch()`, since
the values of the positional arguments don't match up.

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_d1_decorator",
  find = "functions",
  where = Decorator(
    fully_qualified_name.matches("d1"),
    arguments.contains(a, 2)
  ),
  ...
)
```

For keyword arguments in `arguments.contains()`, the specified keyword arguments
must be a subset of the decorator's keyword arguments, but can be specified in
any order. For example, with the following Python code:

```python
@d1(a, 2, foo="Bar")
def match1():
  ...

@d1(baz="Boo", foo="Bar")
def match2():
  ...
```

This query will match both `match1()` and `match2()`:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_d1_decorator",
  find = "functions",
  where = Decorator(
    fully_qualified_name.matches("d1"),
    arguments.contains(foo="Bar")
  ),
  ...
)
```

`arguments.equals()` operates similarly, but will only match if the specified
arguments match the decorator's arguments exactly. This means that for
positional arguments, all arguments in each position must match by value
exactly. Keyword arguments can be specified in a different order, but the set of
specified keyword arguments and the set of the decorator's actual keyword
arguments must be the same. For example, with the following Python code:

```python
@d1(a, 2, foo="Bar", baz="Boo")
def match1():
  ...

@d1(a, 2, baz="Boo", foo="Bar")
def match2():
  ...

@d1(2, a, baz="Boo", foo="Bar")
def nomatch1():
  ...

@d1(a, 2, 3, baz="Boo", foo="Bar")
def nomatch2():
  ...
```

This query will match both `match1()` and `match2()`, but not `nomatch1()` or
`nomatch2()`:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_d1_decorator",
  find = "functions",
  where = Decorator(
    fully_qualified_name.matches("d1"),
    arguments.equals(a, 2, foo="bar", baz="Boo")
  ),
  ...
)
```

#### Decorator `Not`, `AllOf` and `AnyOf` clauses

The `Not`, `AllOf` and `AnyOf` clauses can be used in decorators clauses in the
same way as they are in the main `where` clause of the model query.

### `cls.fully_qualified_name.equals` clause

You may use the `cls` clause to specify predicates on the class. This predicate
can only be used when the find clause specifies methods or attributes.

The `cls.fully_qualified_name.equals` clause is used to model entities when the
class's fully qualified name is an exact match for the specified string.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_childOf_foo_Bar",
  find = "methods",
  where = cls.name.equals("foo.Bar"),
  ...
)
```

### `cls.fully_qualified_name.matches` clause

The `cls.fully_qualified_name.matches` clause is used to model entities when the
class's fully qualified name matches the provided regex.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_childOf_Foo",
  find = "methods",
  where = cls.fully_qualified_name.matches(".*Foo.*"),
  ...
)
```

### `cls.name.matches` clause

The `cls.name.matches` clause is similar to `cls.fully_qualified_name.matches`,
but matches against the actual name of the class, excluding modules.

### `cls.name.equals` clause

The `cls.name.equals` clause is similar to `cls.fully_qualified_name.equals`,
but matches against the actual name of the class, excluding modules.

### `cls.extends` clause

The `cls.extends` clause is used to model entities when the class is a subclass
of the provided class name.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_subclassOf_C",
  find = "attributes",
  where = cls.extends("C"),
  ...
)
```

The default behavior is that it will only match if the class is an instance of,
or a direct subclass of the specified class. For example, with classes:

```python
class C:
  x = ...

class D(C):
  y = ...

class E(D):
  z = ...
```

the above query will only model the attributes `C.z` and `D.y`, since `C` is
considered to extend itself, and `D` is a direct subclass of `C`. However, it
will not model `E.z`, since `E` is a sub-subclass of `C`.

If you would like to model a class and all subclasses transitively, you can use
the `is_transitive` flag.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_transitive_subclassOf_C",
  find = "attributes",
  where = cls.extends("C", is_transitive=True),
  ...
)
```

This query will model `C.x`, `D.y` and `E.z`.

If you do not want to match on the class itself, you can use the `includes_self`
flag.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_transitive_subclassOf_C",
  find = "attributes",
  where = cls.extends("C", is_transitive=True, includes_self=False),
  ...
)
```

This query will model `D.y` and `E.z`.

### `cls.decorator` clause

The `cls.decorator` clause is used to specify constraints on a class decorator,
so you can choose to model entities on classes only if the class it is part of
has the specified decorator.

The arguments for this clause are identical to the non-class constraint
`Decorator`, for more information, please see the
[`Decorator` clauses](#decorator-clauses) section.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_childOf_d1_decorator_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = [
    cls.decorator(
      fully_qualified_name.matches("d1"),
      arguments.contains(2)
    ),
    name.equals("__init__")
  ],
  model = [
    Parameters(TaintSource[Test], where=[
        Not(name.equals("self")),
        Not(name.equals("a"))
    ])
  ]
)
```

For example, the above query when run on the following code:

```python
@d1(2)
class Foo:
  def __init__(self, a, b):
     ...

@d1()
class Bar:
  def __init__(self, a, b):
    ...

@d2(2)
class Baz:
  def __init__(self, a, b):
    ...
```

will result in a model for `def Foo.__init__(b: TaintSource[Test])`.

### `cls.any_child` clause

The `cls.any_child` clause is used to model entities when any child of the
current class meets the specified constraints.

The arguments for this clause are any combination of valid class constraints
(`cls.name.equals`, `cls.name.matches`, `cls.fully_qualified_name.equals`,
`cls.fully_qualified_name.matches`, `cls.extends`, `cls.decorator`) and logical
clauses (`AnyOf`, `AllOf`, `Not`), along with the optional `is_transitive` and
`includes_self` clauses.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_parent_of_d1_decorator_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = [
    cls.any_child(
      cls.decorator(
        fully_qualified_name.matches("d1"),
        arguments.contains(2)
      )
    ),
    name.equals("__init__")
  ],
  model = [
    Parameters(TaintSource[Test], where=[
        Not(name.equals("self")),
        Not(name.equals("a"))
    ])
  ]
)
```

Similar to the `cls.extends` constraint, the default behavior is that it will
only match if any immediate children (or itself) of the class of the method or
attribute matches against the inner clause. For example, with classes:

```python
class Foo:
  def __init__(self, a, b):
     ...

class Bar(Foo):
  def __init__(self, a, b):
    ...

@d1(2)
class Baz(Bar):
  def __init__(self, a, b):
    ...
```

The above query will only model the methods `Bar.__init__` and `Baz.__init__`,
since `Bar` is an immediate parent of `Baz`, and `Baz` is considered to extend
itself. However, it will not model `Foo.__init__`, since `Bar` is a sub-subclass
of `Foo`.

If you would like to model a class and all subclasses transitively, you can use
the `is_transitive` flag.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_transitive_parent_of_d1_decorator_sources",
  find = "attributes",
  where = [
    cls.any_child(
      cls.decorator(
        fully_qualified_name.matches("d1"),
        arguments.contains(2)
      ),
      is_transitive=True
    ),
    name.equals("__init__")
  ],
  ...
)
```

This query will model `Foo.__init__`, `Bar.__init__` and `Baz.__init__`.

If you would like to model all subclasses of a class excluding itself, you can
use the `includes_self` flag.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_transitive_parent_of_d1_decorator_sources",
  find = "attributes",
  where = [
    cls.any_child(
      cls.decorator(
        fully_qualified_name.matches("d1"),
        arguments.contains(2)
      ),
      is_transitive=True,
      includes_self=False
    ),
    name.equals("__init__")
  ],
  ...
)
```

This query will model `Foo.__init__`, `Bar.__init__` but NOT `Baz.__init__`.

We recommend to always specify both `is_transitive` and `includes_self` to avoid
confusion.

### `cls.any_parent` clause

The `cls.any_parent` clause is used to model entities when any parent of the
current class meets the specified constraints.

The arguments for this clause are any combination of valid class constraints
(`cls.name.equals`, `cls.name.matches`, `cls.fully_qualified_name.equals`,
`cls.fully_qualified_name.matches`, `cls.extends`, `cls.decorator`) and logical
clauses (`AnyOf`, `AllOf`, `Not`), along with the optional `is_transitive` and
`includes_self` clauses.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_children_of_d1_decorator_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = [
    cls.any_parent(
      cls.decorator(
        fully_qualified_name.matches("d1"),
        arguments.contains(2)
      )
    ),
    name.equals("__init__")
  ],
  model = [
    Parameters(TaintSource[Test], where=[
        Not(name.equals("self")),
        Not(name.equals("a"))
    ])
  ]
)
```

Similar to the `cls.extends` constraint, the default behavior is that it will
only match if any immediate parent (or itself) of the class of the method or
attribute matches against the inner clause. For example, with classes:

```python
@d1(2)
class Foo:
  def __init__(self, a, b):
     ...

class Bar(Foo):
  def __init__(self, a, b):
    ...

class Baz(Bar):
  def __init__(self, a, b):
    ...
```

The above query will only model the methods `Bar.__init__` and `Foo.__init__`,
since `Foo` is an immediate parent of `Bar`, and `Foo` is considered to extend
itself. However, it will not model `Baz.__init__`, since `Foo` is not an
immediate parent of `Baz`.

If you would like to model a class and all transitive parents, you can use the
`is_transitive` flag.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_transitive_children_of_d1_decorator_sources",
  find = "attributes",
  where = [
    cls.any_parent(
      cls.decorator(
        fully_qualified_name.matches("d1"),
        arguments.contains(2)
      ),
      is_transitive=True
    ),
    name.equals("__init__")
  ],
  ...
)
```

This query will model `Foo.__init__`, `Bar.__init__` and `Baz.__init__`.

If you would like to model all parents of a class excluding itself, you can use
the `includes_self` flag.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_transitive_parent_of_d1_decorator_sources",
  find = "attributes",
  where = [
    cls.any_parent(
      cls.decorator(
        fully_qualified_name.matches("d1"),
        arguments.contains(2)
      ),
      is_transitive=True,
      includes_self=False
    ),
    name.equals("__init__")
  ],
  ...
)
```

This query will model `Bar.__init__`, `Baz.__init__` but NOT `Foo.__init__`.

:::tip

We recommend to always specify both `is_transitive` and `includes_self` to avoid
confusion.

:::

### `Not` clauses

The `Not` clause negates any existing clause that is valid for the entity being
modelled.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_Not_example",
  find = "methods",
  where = [
    Not(
      name.matches("foo.*"),
      cls.fully_qualified_name.matches("testing.unittest.UnitTest"),
    )
  ],
  model = ...
)
```

## Generated models (Model clauses)

The last bit of model queries is actually generating models for all entities
that match the provided where clauses. For callables, we support generating
models for parameters by name or position, as well as generating models for all
paramaters. Additionally, we support generating models for the return
annotation.

### Returned taint

Returned taint takes the form of `Returns(TaintSpecification)`, where
`TaintSpecification` is either a taint annotation or a list of taint
annotations.

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_Returns_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = ...,
  model = [
    Returns(TaintSource[Test, Via[foo]])
  ]
)
```

### Parameter taint

Parameters can be tainted using the `Parameters()` clause. By default, all
parameters will be tained with the supplied taint specification. If you would
like to only taint specific parameters matching certain conditions, an optional
`where` clause can be specified to accomplish this, allowing for constraints on
parameter names, the annotation type of the parameter, or parameter position.
For example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_Parameters_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = ...,
  model = [
    Parameters(TaintSource[A]), # will taint all parameters by default
    Parameters(
      TaintSource[B],
      where=[
        Not(index.equals(0))   # will only taint parameters that are not the first parameter
      ]
    ),
  ]
)
```

#### `name` clauses

To specify a constraint on parameter name, the `name.equals()` or
`name.matches()` clauses can be used. As in the main `where` clause of the model
query, `equals()` searches for an exact match on the specified string, while
`matches()` allows a regex to be supplied as a pattern to match against.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_request_data_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = ...,
  model = [
    Parameters(
      TaintSource[Test],
      where=[
        name.equals("request"),
        name.matches("data$")
      ]
    )
  ]
)
```

#### `index` clause

To specify a constraint on parameter position, the `index.equals()` clause can
be used. It takes a single integer denoting the position of the parameter.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_index_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = ...,
  model = [
    Parameters(
      TaintSource[Test],
      where=[
        index.equals(1)
      ]
    )
  ]
)
```

#### `has_position` clause

To match on parameters that have a position, the `has_position()` clause can be
used. This is mostly used to exclude keyword-only parameters, `*args` and
`**kwargs`.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_index_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = ...,
  model = [
    Parameters(
      TaintSource[Test],
      where=[
        has_position()
      ]
    )
  ]
)
```

#### `has_name` clause

To match on parameters that have a name, the `has_name()` clause can be used.
This is mostly used to exclude `*args` and `**kwargs`.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_index_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = ...,
  model = [
    Parameters(
      TaintSource[Test],
      where=[
        has_name()
      ]
    )
  ]
)
```

#### `type_annotation` clause

This clause is used to specify a constraint on parameter type annotation.
Currently the clauses supported are: `type_annotation.equals()`, which takes the
fully-qualified name of a Python type or class and matches when there is an
exact match, `type_annotation.matches()`, which takes a regex pattern to match
type annotations against, and `type_annotation.is_annotated_type()`, which will
match parameters of type
[`typing.Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated).

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_annotated_parameters_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = ...,
  model = [
    Parameters(
      TaintSource[Test],
      where=[
        type_annotation.equals("foo.bar.C"),  # exact match
        type_annotation.matches("^List\["),   # regex match
        type_annotation.is_annotated_type(),  # matches Annotated[T, x]
      ]
    )
  ]
)
```

To match on the annotation portion of `Annotated` types, consider the following
example. Suppose this code was in `test.py`:

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import Annotated, Option

class Color(Enum):
    RED = 1
    GREEN = 2
    BLUE = 3

class Foo:
  x: Annotated[Optional[int], Color.RED]
  y: Annotated[Optional[int], Color.BLUE]
  z: Annotated[int, "z"]
```

Note that the type name that should be matched against is its fully qualified
name, which also includes the fully qualified name of any other types referenced
(for example, `typing.Optional` rather than just `Optional`). When multiple
arguments are provided to the type they are implicitly treated as being in a
tuple.

Here are some examples of `where` clauses that can be used to specify models for
the annotated attributes in this case:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_annotated_attributes_sources",
  find = "attributes",
  where = [
    AnyOf(
      type_annotation.equals("typing.Annotated[(typing.Optional[int], test.Color.RED)]"),
      type_annotation.equals("typing.Annotated[(int, z)]"),
      type_annotation.matches(".*Annotated\[.*Optional[int].*Color\..*\]")
      type_annotation.is_annotated_type()
    )
  ],
  model = [
    AttributeModel(TaintSource[Test]),
  ]
)
```

This query should generate the following models:

```
test.Foo.x: TaintSource[Test]
test.Foo.y: TaintSource[Test]
test.Foo.z: TaintSource[Test]
```

#### `Not`, `AllOf` and `AnyOf` clauses

The `Not`, `AllOf` and `AnyOf` clauses can be used in the same way as they are
in the main `where` clause of the model query. `Not` can be used to negate any
existing clause, `AllOf` to match when all of several supplied clauses match,
and `AnyOf` can be used to match when any one of several supplied clauses match.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_Not_AnyOf_AllOf_example_sources",
  find = "methods",
  where = ...,
  model = [
    Parameters(
      TaintSource[Test],
      where=[
        Not(
          AnyOf(
            AllOf(
              cls.extends("a.b"),
              cls.name.matches("Foo"),
            ),
            AllOf(
              cls.extends("c.d"),
              cls.name.matches("Bar")
            )
          )
        )
      ]
    )
  ]
)
```

#### Using `ViaTypeOf` with the `Parameters` clause

Usually when specifying a `ViaTypeOf` the argument that you want to capture the
value or type of should be specified. However, when writing model queries and
trying to find all parameters that match certain conditions, we may not know the
exact name of the parameters that will be modelled. For example:

```python
def f1(bad_1, good_1, good_2):
  pass

def f2(good_3, bad_2, good_4):
  pass
```

Suppose we wanted to model all parameters with the prefix `bad_` here and attach
a `ViaTypeOf` to them. In this case it is still possible to attach these
features to the parameter model, by using a standalone `ViaTypeOf` as follows:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_f_sinks",
  find = "functions",
  where = name.matches("f"),
  model = [
    Parameters(
      TaintSink[Test, ViaTypeOf],
      where=[
        name.matches("bad_")
      ]
    )
  ]
)
```

This would produce models equivalent to the following:

```python
def f1(bad_1: TaintSink[Test, ViaTypeOf[bad_1]]): ...
def f2(bad_2: TaintSink[Test, ViaTypeOf[bad_2]]): ...
```

### Models for attributes

Taint for attribute models requires a `AttributeModel` model clause, which can
only be used when the find clause specifies attributes.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_attribute_sources_sinks",
  find = "attributes",
  where = ...,
  model = [
    AttributeModel(TaintSource[Test], TaintSink[Test])
  ]
)
```

#### Using `ViaAttributeName` with the `AttributeModel` clause

`ViaAttributeName` can be used within `AttributeModel` to add a feature
containing the name of the attribute to any taint flowing through the given
attributes.

For instance:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_attribute_of_Foo",
  find = "attributes",
  where = [cls.name.equals("Foo")],
  model = [
    AttributeModel(ViaAttributeName[WithTag["Foo"]])
  ]
)
```

On the following code:

```python
class Foo:
  first_name: str
  last_name: str

def last_name_to_sink(foo: Foo):
  sink(foo.last_name)
```

This will add the feature `via-Foo-attribute:last_name` on the flow to the sink.

### Models for globals

Taint for global models requires a `GlobalModel` model clause, which can only be
used when the find clause specifies globals.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_global_sources",
  find = "globals",
  where = ...,
  model = [
    GlobalModel(TaintSource[Test])
  ]
)
```

### Models for setting modes

This model clause is different from the others in this section in the sense that
it doesn't produce taint for the models it targets, but updates their models
with specific modes to change their behavior with taint analysis.

The available modes are:

- [`Obscure`](pysa_advanced.md#obscure-models)
  - Marks the function or method as obscure
- [`SkipObscure`](pysa_advanced.md#obscure-models)
  - Prevents a function or method from being marked as obscure
- [`SkipAnalysis`](pysa_advanced.md#prevent-inferring-models-with-skipanalysis)
  - Skips inference of the function or model targeted, and forces the use of
    user-defined models for taint flow
- [`SkipOverrides`](pysa_advanced.md#ignoring-overrides)
  - Prevents taint propagation from the targeted model into and from overridden
    methods on subclasses
- [`Entrypoint`](pysa_advanced.md#filtering-the-call-graph-with-entrypoint)
  - Specifies functions or methods to be used as entrypoints for analysis, so
    only transitive calls from that function are analyzed
- [`SkipDecoratorWhenInlining`](pysa_advanced.md#prevent-inlining-decorators-with-skipdecoratorwheninlining)
  - Prevents the selected decorator from being inlined during analysis
  - Note: this mode will be a no-op, since model queries are generated after
    decorators are inlined
- [`SkipModelBroadening`](pysa_advanced.md#model-broadening)
  - Prevents model broadening for the given function or method

For instance, instead of annotating each function separately, as in the
following `.pysa` file:

```python
@Entrypoint
def myfile.func1(): ...

@Entrypoint
def myfile.func2(): ...

@Entrypoint
def myfile.func3(): ...

@Entrypoint
def myfile.func4(): ...
```

One could instead use the following model query:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_myfile_entrypoint_functions",
  find = "functions",
  where = [
    name.matches("myfile\.func.*")
  ],
  model = [
    Modes([Entrypoint])
  ]
)
```

The benefit is that any new functions that matches that name will also be
considered entrypoints.

Note that it is also possible to include multiple modes in a `Modes` model
clause by extending the list (e.g `Modes([SkipOverrides, Obscure])`.

## Expected and Unexpected Models clauses

The optional `expected_models` and `unexpected_models` clauses allow you to
specify models that your ModelQuery should or should not generate the equivalent
of. The models in these clauses should be syntactically correct Pysa models (see
[this documentation](https://staticdocs.internalfb.com/pyre/docs/pysa-basics/#model-files)
for a guide on how to write a Pysa model). If your query does not generate a
model in `expected_models`, or if it generates a model in `unexpected_models`,
an error will be raised.

Example:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "get_foo_returns_sources",
  find = "functions",
  where = [name.matches("foo")],
  model = [
    Returns(TaintSource[Test]),
  ],
  expected_models = [
    "def file.foo() -> TaintSource[Test]: ...",
    "def file.foo2() -> TaintSource[Test]: ..."
  ],
  unexpected_models = [
    "def file.bar() -> TaintSource[Test]: ..."
  ]
)
```

This would not produce any errors, since the models the ModelQuery generates
will contain `expected_models` and not `unexpected_models`.

## Cache Queries

Generating models for a large number of queries can be quite slow. Cache queries
allow to speed up model generation by factoring out queries with similar `where`
clause into a single query, which builds a mapping from an arbitrary name to a
set of matching entities. Then, other queries can read from this cache, making
them quick to execute.

For instance, imagine having the following queries:

```python
ModelQuery(
  ...
  find = "methods",
  where = [
    AnyOf(cls.extends("my_module.Foo"), cls.extends("other_module.Bar")),
    fully_qualified_name.matches("\.ClassA\.method$"),
  ],
  model = ...
)
ModelQuery(
  ...
  find = "methods",
  where = [
    AnyOf(cls.extends("my_module.Foo"), cls.extends("other_module.Bar")),
    fully_qualified_name.matches("\.ClassB\.method$"),
  ],
  model = ...
)
ModelQuery(
  ...
  find = "methods",
  where = [
    AnyOf(cls.extends("my_module.Foo"), cls.extends("other_module.Bar")),
    fully_qualified_name.matches("\.ClassC\.other_method$"),
  ],
  model = ...
)
# etc.
```

We can factor out the expensive where clause into a single query which writes to
a key-value cache, using the `WriteToCache` clause.

```python
ModelQuery(
  ...
  find = "methods",
  where = [AnyOf(cls.extends("my_module.Foo"), cls.extends("other_module.Bar"))],
  model = WriteToCache(kind="FooBar", name=f"{class_name}:{function_name}")
)
```

All matching methods will be stored in a cache named `FooBar`, under the key
`{class_name}:{function_name}`.

After executing the query, we might get the following cache `FooBar`:

```
ClassA:method -> {some_module.ClassA.method}
ClassB:method -> {some_other_module.ClassB.method}
ClassC:other_method -> {some_module.ClassC.other_method}
```

We can then read from the cache using the where clause `read_from_cache`:

```python
ModelQuery(
  find = "methods",
  where = read_from_cache(kind="FooBar", name="ClassA:method",
  model = ...
)
ModelQuery(
  find = "methods",
  where = read_from_cache(kind="FooBar", name="ClassB:method",
  model = ...
)
ModelQuery(
  find = "methods",
  where = read_from_cache(kind="FooBar", name="ClassC:other_method",
  model = ...
)
```

This will generate the same models as the first example, but model generation
will be a lot faster.

In terms of time complexity, if the number of entities (methods here) is `N`,
the number of queries is `Q` and the average cost of evaluating a where clause
is `C`, the first example would have a `O(N*Q*C)` complexity. Using cache
queries, this turns into `O(N*C+Q)`, which is much better.

### WriteToCache clause

`WriteToCache` is a model clause that is used to store entities into a cache. It
takes the following arguments:

- A `kind`, which is the name of the cache.
- A `name` as a [format string](#format-strings), which will be the key for the
  entity in the cache.

For instance:

```python
ModelQuery(
  ...
  find = "methods",
  model = WriteToCache(kind="cache_name", name=f"{class_name}:{function_name}")
)
```

Note that you can write multiple entities under the same name. For instance,
this happens if you use `name=f"{class_name}"` and multiple methods of the same
class match against the where clause.

### read_from_cache clause

`read_from_cache` is a where clause that will only match against entities with
the given name in the cache. It takes the following arguments:

- A `kind`, which is the name of the cache.
- A `name` as a string, which is the key for the entities in the cache.

For instance:

```python
ModelQuery(
  find = "methods",
  where = read_from_cache(kind="cache_name", name="Class:method"),
  model = ...
)
```

Note that you can use `read_from_cache` in combination with other where clauses,
as long as at least one `read_from_cache` clause is active on all branches.

For instance, this is **disallowed**:

```python
ModelQuery(
  find = "methods",
  where = AnyOf(
    read_from_cache(kind="cache_name", name="Class:method"),
    cls.extends("module.Foo")
  ),
  model = ...
)
```

## Format strings

Format strings can be used to craft a string using information from the matched
entity. They can be used in the `WriteToCache` name argument as well as the
`CrossRepositoryTaintAnchor` canonical name and port arguments.

For instance:

- `WriteToCache(kind="cache_name", name=f"{class_name}:{function_name}")`
- `CrossRepositoryTaintAnchor[TaintSink[Thrift], f"{class_name}:{function_mame}", f"formal({parameter_position + 1})"]`

The following variables can be used:

- `function_name`: The (non-qualified) name of the function;
- `method_name`: The (non-qualified) name of the method;
- `class_name`: The (non-qualified) name of the class;
- `parameter_name`: The parameter name, when used within the `Parameters`
  clause;
- `parameter_position`: The parameter position, when used within the
  `Parameters` clause. This will give -1 for keyword only parameters;
- `capture(identifier)`: The regular expression capture group called
  `identifier`. See documentation below.

Math operators such as `+`, `-` and `*` can be used on `parameter_position` and
integer literals, such as `f"{parameter_position * 2 + 1}"`.

### Regular expression capture

`name.matches` and `cls.name.matches` clause can use named capturing groups,
which can be used in the `name` of `WriteToCache` clauses.

For instance:

```python
ModelQuery(
  find = "functions",
  where = name.matches("^get_(?P<attribute>[a-z]+)$"),
  model = WriteToCache(kind="cache_name", name=f"{capture(attribute)}")
)
```

For a function `get_foo`, this will create a cache for key `foo`.

:::caution

Be careful when using regular expression captures. If the capture group is not
found (e.g, a typo), `WriteToCache` will use the empty string.

:::

Note that we do not support numbered capture groups, e.g `Foo(.*)`.

## Logging group clauses

The `logging_group_name` clause specifies that the model query should be
considered part of the given group for logging purposes. This is useful when
auto generating large amounts of model queries. When verbose logging is enabled
(`-n`), Pysa will print a single line
`Model Query group 'XXX' generated YYY models` instead of printing one line per
model query in the group.

For instance:

```python
ModelQuery(
  name = "generated_dangerous_foo",
  logging_group_name = "generated_dangerous",
  find = "methods",
  where = read_from_cache(kind="annotated", name="foo"),
  model = ...
)
ModelQuery(
  name = "generated_dangerous_bar",
  logging_group_name = "generated_dangerous",
  find = "methods",
  where = read_from_cache(kind="annotated", name="bar"),
  model = ...
)
```
