class Timer:
    """
    A simple utility class to facilitate clock duration computation.

    A ``Timer`` object tracks one single state: the timestamp at which the timer
    starts. It provides various ``stop`` methods which returns the duration from
    the moment of the stop method is invoked to the moment when the timer starts.

    The benefit of using this class over using the ``time`` module in the standard
    library is that this module provides a more readable interfaces with respect to
    the resolution of the duration.
