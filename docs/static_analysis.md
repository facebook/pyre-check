Pyre has applications beyond typechecking python code. It can also run static
analysis and identify potential security issues in python code.

## Taint Analysis

**Tainted data** is data that must be treated carefully. As general examples,
sensitive data should not be logged and user-controlled data should be sanitized.

Using stubs, we can define where in our code there exist taint sources
(ex. user input) and sinks (ex. system call). Pyre uses these stubs to surface
data flows from sources to sinks as potential security issues.

## Example

Let's look at a simple taint analysis example. To follow along, create a
directory `static_analysis_example` and navigate to it.

### Setup

The setup requires the following 4 files.

#### 1. Source Code

```python
# static_analysis_example/source.py

import os

def get_image(url):
    command = "wget -q https:{}".format(url)
    return os.system(command)

def convert():
    image_link = input("image link: ")
    image = get_image(image_link)
```

Notice the following:
* The `input` function is a taint source since it gets input directly from
  the user.
* The `os.system` function is a taint sink, since we do not want user-controlled
  values to flow into it.
* The return value of `input` is used as the URL for a `wget` call, which is
  executed by `os.system`. The `wget` can therefore be doing anything, out of
  the programmer's control.
* This data flow should be identified as a potential security issue.

#### 2. Taint Config

```python
# static_analysis_example/stubs/taint/taint.config

{
  sources: [
    {
      name: "UserSpecified",
      comment: "use to annotate user input"
    }
  ],

  sinks: [
    {
      name: "RemoteCodeExecution",
      comment: "use to annotate execution of code"
    }
  ],

  features: [],

  rules: [
    {
      name: "Possible shell injection",
      code: 5001,
      sources: [ "UserSpecified" ],
      sinks: [ "RemoteCodeExecution" ],
      message_format: "Data from [{$sources}] source(s) may reach [{$sinks}] sink(s)"
    }
  ]
}
```

This declares the valid sources and sinks that Pyre should recognize. We
also tell Pyre that data flowing from a `UserSpecified` source to a
`RemoteCodeExecution` sink is a possible shell injection.

#### 3. Taint Stubs

```python
# static_analysis_example/stubs/taint/general.pysa

# model for raw_input
def input(__prompt = ...) -> TaintSource[UserSpecified]: ...

# model for os.system
def os.system(command: TaintSink[RemoteCodeExecution]): ...
```

This file links together the information in `source.py` and `taint.config`. We
use it to tell Pyre where in our code there exist sources and sinks.

#### 4. Pyre Configuration

```python
# static_analysis_example/.pyre_configuration

{
  "source_directories": ["."],
  "taint_models_path": "stubs/taint"
}
```

Pyre needs to know what directory to analyze, as well as where to find the config
and stub files.

### Analysis

Now let's run the static analysis:

```shell
[~/static_analysis_example] $ pyre analyze
 Æ› Fixpoint iterations: 2
[
  {
    "line": 9,
    "column": 22,
    "path": "source.py",
    "code": 5001,
    "name": "Possible shell injection",
    "description":
      "Possible shell injection [5001]: Data from [UserSpecified] source(s) may reach [RemoteCodeExecution] sink(s)",
    "long_description":
      "Possible shell injection [5001]: Data from [UserSpecified] source(s) may reach [RemoteCodeExecution] sink(s)",
    "concise_description":
      "Possible shell injection [5001]: Data from [UserSpecified] source(s) may reach [RemoteCodeExecution] sink(s)",
    "inference": null,
    "define": "source.convert"
  }
]
```

Looking at the output, we see that pyre surfaces the tainted data flow that we
expected.

Let's run it again and save the results:

```shell
[~/static_analysis_example] $ pyre analyze --save-results-to ./
```

The `--save-results-to` option will save more detailed results to
`./taint-output.json`.
