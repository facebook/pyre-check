# Pyrefly Configuration

Pyrefly has a basic configuration that can (or will) allow you to customize your
Pyrefly runs without having to specify all of your arguments on the command
line.

NOTE: this is early in its development, so the options listed here are subject
to change in name, usage, type, quantity, and structure.

Configurations can be specified in a [TOML file](https://toml.io/en/) at the root of
your project (or elsewhere, as long as the `search_path` is correct) named
`pyrefly.toml`, with all configuration options in the top-level of the document.
You can also specify a configuration in a `pyproject.toml` under a `[tool.pyrefly]`
section. Other config names can be used when explicitly passing in the config file
name with the `--config`/`-c` flag, but they will not be automatically found by
[Configuration Finding](#configuration-finding).

Both absolute and config-relative paths are supported.

## Precedence in Options

The following is the order in which configuration options are selected:

1. CLI flag
2. Environment variable override -- This is the same as `PYRE_<CLI flag name>`
3. Configuration option
4. Hard-coded default

# Configuration Finding

In both project checking mode (with no explicit configuration supplied) and
single-file checking mode, we perform an upward file search to find a
configuration file. We check each directory from the start location to the
filesystem root, looking first for `pyrefly.toml` then `pyproject.toml`, in
the same directory before looking at its parent.

For project checking mode, the start location is the CWD. We do not perform any
searching if the `--config`/`-c` flag is used. For single-file checking mode,
the start location is the directory containing the file to be type checked. No
config flag can be passed into Pyrefly in single file checking mode.

If a `pyrefly.toml` is found, it is parsed and used for type checking, and will
return an error to the user on invalid types, syntax, or values.

If a `pyproject.toml` is found, Pyrefly will stop searching, even if no `[tool.pyrefly]`
section is found. The same errors will be returned as when loading a `pyrefly.toml` if
the config is invalid.

# Configuration Options

- `project_includes`: the glob patterns used to describe which files to type
  check, typically understood as user-space files. This takes highest precedence
  in import resolution.
  - Type: list of Unix Glob patterns
  - Default: `["**/*.py"]`
  - Flag equivalent: `FILES...` argument
  - Equivalent configs: `include` in Pyright, `files`/`modules`/`packages` in
    mypy
  - Notes:
    - When overridden by passing in `FILES...`, we do not consult the
      relevant config file for what to use for `project_excludes`. If
      `project_excludes` should not use the default, override it with the flag as
      well.
    - When a `project_includes` pattern does not match any files, we will return
      an error.
- `project_excludes`: the glob patterns used to describe which files to avoid
  type checking, usually as a more fine-grained way of controlling the files you
  get type errors on.
  - Type: list of Unix Glob patterns
  - Default: `["**/__pycache__/**", "**/.*"]`
  - Flag equivalent: `--project-excludes`
  - Equivalent configs: `exclude` in Pyright and mypy
  - Notes:
    - We match on these patterns, unlike `project_includes`, where we
      enumerate all (Python) files under the directory. Because of this,
      `project_excludes` does not do directory matching unless a `/` is added at
      the end of your glob pattern. `**/__pycache__/` will only match files under
      a directory named `__pycache__/`, but not a file named `__pycache__`.
      Likewise, `**/__pycache__` will only match files named `__pycache__`, but
      not files under a directory named `__pycache__/`.
    - It is an error if no files are returned from any `project_includes` because
      they are filtered out by `project_excludes` entries.
- `search_path`: a file path describing a root from which imports should be
  found and imported from (including modules in `project_includes`). This takes
  the highest precedence in import order, before `typeshed` and
  `site_package_path`. When a `project_includes` type checked file is imported
  by another type checked file, we check all search roots to determine how to
  import it.
  - Type: list of directories
  - Default: `["."]`
  - Flag equivalent: `--search-path`
  - ENV equivalent: `PYRE_SEARCH_PATH`
  - Equivalent configs: `extraPaths` in Pyright, `mypy_path` in mypy
  - Notes: we automatically append `"."` (the directory containing the
    configuration file) to the `search_roots` when type checking as a sensible
    default and last attempt at an import.
- `site_package_path`: a file path describing a root from which imports should
  be found and imported from. This takes the lowest priority in import
  resolution, after `project_includes`, `typeshed`, and `search_roots`.
  - Type: list of directories
  - Default: result from [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration) or `[]`
  - Flag equivalent: `--site-package-path`
  - ENV equivalent: `PYRE_SITE_PACKAGE_PATH`
  - Equivalent configs: none
- `python_platform`: the value used with conditions based on type checking
  against
  [`sys.platform`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform)
  values.
  - Type: string
  - Default: result from [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration) or "linux"
  - Flag equivalent: `--python-platform`
  - ENV equivalent: `PYRE_PYTHON_PLATFORM`
  - Equivalent configs: `pythonPlatform` in Pyright, `platform` in mypy
- `python_version`: the value used with conditions based on type checking
  against
  [`sys.version`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version)
  values. The format should be `<major>[.<minor>[.<micro>]]`, where minor and
  micro can be omitted to take the default positional value.
  - Type: string
  - Default: result from [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration) or `3.13.0`
  - Flag equivalent: `--python-version`
  - ENV equivalent: `PYRE_PYTHON_VERSION`
  - Equivalent configs: `pythonVersion` in Pyright, `python_version` in mypy
- `python_interpreter`: the Python interpreter to query when attempting to autoconfigure
  Python environment values (`site_package_path`, `python_platform`, `python_version`).
  See the [Environment Autoconfiguration section](#environment-autoconfiguration) for more information.
  - Type: string of executable or path to executable
  - Default: `python3`
  - Flag equivalent: `--python-interpreter`
  - ENV equivalent: `PYRE_PYTHON_INTERPRETER`
  - Equivalent configs: `python_executable` in mypy
  - Notes:
    - This executes the value present in the `python_interpreter` field without any checks. It could
      be a security risk if your `python_interpreter` executes an arbitrary executable.
    - If you are working on a project shared between multiple people, it is likely best not to use this
      option, since there might be different Python interpreter versions used on different systems. Instead,
      we recommend explicitly setting `python_version`, `python_platform`, and `site_package_path`, or using
      alternative methods of environment autoconfiguration (coming soon).
- `errors`: configure (enable and disable) the errors Pyrefly shows
  - Type: Table of error code name to boolean representing enabled status
  - Default: `errors = {}`
  - Flag equivalent: none
  - ENV equivalent: none
  - Equivalent configs:
    [type check rule overrides](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=type-check-rule-overrides)
    and [type evaluation settings](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=type-evaluation-settings)
    in Pyright,
    [`enable_error_code`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-enable_error_code) and
    [`disable_error_code`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-disable_error_code)
    in mypy
  - Notes: setting `<error-code> = true` is the same as having no error code configuration present, which means
    the error will be shown. Setting `<error-code> = false` will disable the error for type checking.
- `ignore_missing_imports_from`: string-prefix-matched names of modules from which import errors should be
  ignored. For example, if Pyrefly can't find `from x.y import z`, adding `x`, `x.` or `x.y` to this config will
  silence those import errors and replace the module with `typing.Any`. If the module can be found, its type
  information will still be loaded, and will not be replaced with `typing.Any`.
  - Type: list of string prefixes
  - Default: `[]`
  - Flag equivalent: none
  - ENV equivalent: none
  - Equivalent configs: `ignore_missing_imports` in mypy
  - Notes: `reportMissingImports = false` has similar behavior in Pyright, but ignores *all* import errors instead
    of import errors from specific modules.

# Environment Autoconfiguration

If any of `python_platform`, `python_version`, or `site_package_path` are empty, we attempt to query an interpreter
for the missing values. By default we query `python3` if it's available on the path, but the interpreter can be
overridden with the `python_interpreter` config option and flag. If the interpreter does not exist, we fall back to
Pyrefly's defaults for all unspecified values.

The values queried from the interpreter are:
* `python_platform`: `sys.platform`
* `python_version`: `sys.version_info[:3]`
* `site_package_path`: `site.getsitepackages()`
