## Avoid more than one newline in nested control flow statements
# We need to avoid two newlines being output after asdasd = 8
# i.e. not one after the final statement of the for loop immediatly followed by
# one orignating from after the for statement itself

for x in requests.items():
    for x in requests.items():
        asdasd = 8
    dest = 3

## comment nesting in control loops
for a in b:
  for c in d:
    test(a, c)  # comment0  # comment1
    # comment2
  # comment3
# comment4

## with other logic straight after the comment
for a in b:
  for c in d:
    test(a, c)  # comment0  # comment1
    # comment2
    something()
  # comment3
  something()
# comment4
something()


## extra dot needed on attribute access of integer
z = 123123 .b                    # formatted as: <int> .b
g =  5 .thing()                  # formatted as: <int> .thing()
a = 1223423423423425345345346 .z # formatted as: <bigInt> .z
f = 567567567567.567 . j         # formatted as: <float>.j
f = 567567567567.567j . j        # formatted as: <float>j.j

## params are required for unambiguous pretty printing of these
h = (2 + 4) * 3
h = 2 + 4 * 3
h = 2 + (4 * 3)

## mixture of Terms and arithmetic with params
g = ( 1 + 2 ) * 3
g = 1 + (2  * 3)
g = 1 + 2  * 3

## Complex case which showed bug concerning params around boolean operators
a = not a if (4**3 / 2) > 4 else (3 and 4) % (1 + 3) * 2

## boolean operator param placement
(3 and 4) % (1 + 3)
(3 and 4) % 1 + 3
3 and 4 % (1 + 3)
3 and (4 % 1) + 3
3 and 4 % 1 + 3

## pow operator is right associative
(a + b) ** ( c + d)
a + (b **  c) + d
(a + b **  c) + d
a + (b ** c + d)

## compare operators can be tricky
a < b < c
a < (b < c)
(a < b) < c

## preserve params on parenthesized_expression
a.thing()
a().thing()
(a+b).thing()

## indentation for try except statement
def do_thing():
    try:
 	    something()
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

## indentation for try finally statement

def do_thing():
    try:
 	    something()
    finally:
        something_else(e)

## indentation for try else statement

def do_thing2():
    try:
 	    something()
    except e:
 	    something_err()
    else:
        something_else(e)

## improve newline placement for async functions
class Bar:
    def bar(self):
        pass

    def bar(self):
        pass

class Foo:
    async def bar(self):
        pass

    async def bar(self):
        pass

## indentation for functions with annotations
class Bar:
    @annot
    def bar(self):
        pass

    @annot
    def bar(self):
        pass

class Foo:
    @annot
    async def bar(self):
        pass

    @annot
    async def bar(self):
        pass

## formatting of if-else starting with an if
if cond1 == 2:
    pass
else: # this is turned into an elif
    if cond2 == "py2":
        pass
    # as the block just contains an if

if cond1 == 2:
    pass
else: # this is not turned into elif
    if cond2 == "py2":
        pass
    x = 3 # because the block contains other things besides an if

## no comma popping for empty tuples
a[b] = ((), c)
