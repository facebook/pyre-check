## Name(id, ctx)
a

## Load
a

## Store
a = 1 # lhs has store applied, rhs is load

## Del
del a
del a, b, c

## Starred(value, ctx)
a, *b = it

## simple assignments
a=9
b=a

## simple assignments 2
a=9
b=a

## Assign(targets, value, type_comment)
a = b = 1
a,b = c

b = 99
a = 88
c = d = 6

## AnnAssign(target, annotation, value, simple)
c: int
aa: int = 99
(a): int = 1
a.b: int
a[1]: int

## AugAssign(target, op, value)
x += 2

## tuple and list assignments rhs and lhs
(a,b) = xxx
a, b = xxx
[a,b] = xxx

xx = [1,2]
xx = (1,2)
xx = 1,2

xx = {1,2}

## yield on rhs of assignment
ff = yield
ff = yield yy
ff = yield from yy

## bugfix 1 item tuple, should resolve to just name unless ended with comma
b = (a)
b = (a,)

(a) = 3
(a, ) = 3
