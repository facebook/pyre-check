type errors = Analysis.AnalysisError.t list [@@deriving show]

(* Given a list of changed files, perform incremental type check and update the type environment
   along with the error table. This is a stateful API: both `environment` and `errors` get mutated
   after this function is invoked. *)
(* Note that the return value is a list of rechecked modules and the type errors contained within
   those modules only. It does NOT return a list of all type errors after the recheck. If one wants
   all errors instead, query the `errors` table. *)
